Billionaire's Blunder is about leveraging your ego to take your custom-built submarine down into the depths of the ocean without it getting destroyed. Depth pressure isn't the only concernâ€”there are other hazards and creatures. And if you take too much damage, you can abort the mission to return and upgrade your submarine, and try again. Or push your luck to see if you catch your big break.
